# Merging an upstream repository into your fork
git pull https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git BRANCH_NAME


### tag
You just need to push an 'empty' reference to the remote tag name:
git push origin :tagname

Or, more expressively, use the --delete option (or -d if your git version is older than 1.8.0):
git push --delete origin tagname

If you also need to delete the local tag, use:
git tag --delete tagname
